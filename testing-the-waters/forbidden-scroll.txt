you're back in town to help close your parents' estate.
--------------------------------------------

insert: wander around town before meeting Kit
--------------------------------------------
    

        KIT
What do you want, then?

        HELEN
I don't know. Just, something else.

        WAITRESS
Everything going ok? Anything else I can get for you guys?

        KIT
No thanks. Thanks--

        HELEN
Actually, do you know if there's any way I could rent one of those boats off the pier for a couple hours?

(shot cut to pier thru window)
(back, etc)

--------------------------------------------
--SCENE!--
--------------------------------------------

@ boat rentals place, acquiring a boat!

(the service window is wide open. a lamp CLICKS on.
this is what's called "farm-to-table television". with perfect framing,
we are looking straight-on at a poster: some half-assed vector graphic
of a blond-headed guy who bears a striking resemblance to Kevin Costner's character in Waterworld...)

[fumbling into view, and falling in line with the poster 
of his cartoon counterpart: (woah! it's a-)]

        GUY WHO LOOKS LIKE KEVIN COSTNER FOR WHATEVER REASON
    (cradling a heaping pile of fresh-caught fish)
    (while speaking, a deposit of particularly slimy fish 
    steadily builds at his feet.)
What can I do youz for?

        HELEN
Waitress over at Monk's says you've got boats.

        GUY WHO LOOKS LIKE KEVIN COSTNER ETC
    (overly enthusiastic for whatever reason)
I've got boats. And what my boats've got is something special.
[---------
    (very tender, suddenly)
These bad boys--
[ cut below omg! lol!! ]
[The way single women feel about dogs, that's how I feel about my boats...]
    (begins to tear up) (idk lol)
    (break-)
Anyways, yeah. Boats. 
--------]
Rentals start at sixty bucks 'n hour!

        HELEN
No chance you do like, reduced pricing for [the unemployed]?

        KIT
    (glare of death and disappointment @ helen)

        GUY WHO LOOKS LIKE KEVIN ETC
    (inspired by the sight of slimy floor fish and cosmic indifference,
    he surrenders the remaining arm fish to the floor)
I'll see what I can do.
(Kevin etc. slaps his slimy hands around on his pants and heads out 
toward the shipyard)

* ^ here's where u can choose a path!! ^ *
> u can ask for reduced pricing or! you can say something nice for once, maybe..
    i) if u ask for reduced pricing, he will give u his most worst boat.
        sowwie!!
        a) u get stuck on island and have to swim back
    ii) if u say something nice maybe he will just be nice to you..
        what a concept!

--
(don't forget to make it clear that Kit is just here, reluctantly, watching things play out.)

Kevin etc, comes back with keys to one of the boats, and hands them over to Helen.

--

[bro i went to the scene about the island but i didn't
actually because i couldn't find it. maybe this fucking lazy 
idiot narrator was too fucking lazy to write it?]

--

[bro, i think i found the island scene]

At the dock, Helen and Kit load and board the boat in silence. 
They set sail.
It is silent for a long while. It is silent until Kit finds the right words.

Licks of deep blue lap at the sides of the rickety boat.

        KIT
Unemployed, huh?

        HELEN
(Helen has yet to find the right words.)

A lone crest of land rolls into view. Charred support beams hold eachother close. They are stronger together. 

        HELEN
    (a late reply, lost in thought)
That's new.

        KIT
What?

        HELEN
The unemployment. 

        KIT
Right.
For a second there, I thought you were pretending to forget what you'd done.

        HELEN
    (a shift in energy)
I didn't--

        KIT
Didn't what?
Dissappear?
Commit arson?

        HELEN
No--

        KIT
I don't want to hear it. 
I don't even know why I stepped foot onto this boat in the first place.

        HELEN
Kit!

---------------------------------------------
@burnt-fort island

[Maybe there is no right thing to say. Maybe it's best this boat ride proceeds in silence.]
Finally, the boat scuffs against the sand.
Helen and Kit step out of the boat.
---------------------------------------------
[insert scannable image of the fort ruins here. hovering over various elements will activate tooltips.]
    Tooltip'd items--
   -Empty lighter. The print reads, "Shrimp City Beach".
   -Support beams. Every great empire ends in great defeat. 
   -Boat. Sea yourself out.

> say you killed the dog.

(or click on the boat to leave. do not indicate this to the user.)
--------------------------------------------

Helen stations herself in the sand, her back to the ruins. Much time elapses.

        HELEN
For what it's worth, this isn't how I meant for things to go.

        KIT
I know why you're back.

        HELEN
Yeah?

        KIT
Yeah. I heard about your father-- we all did.

        HELEN
Oh.
I guess it's true what they say...

        KIT
Hm?

        HELEN
... about []?
    
        KIT
Do they say that?

        HELEN
Who knows.. ---

        KIT
You know, I would've thought you'd be more sympathetic about my mother's death, considering your current circumstances.

        HELEN
And yet --

        KIT
Some things just never change, huh?

        HELEN
Well, I do have a prestigious new piece of paper on my wall now.

        KIT
You've never taken life seriously. I'm starting to think you never will.

        HELEN
You're kidding--

        KIT
Helen. Look at me. Look around you.

        HELEN
Look at what, Kit? Another fucking-god-damn lifeless corpse?

        KIT
Sure, yeah.

        HELEN
Yeah? And then what?

        KIT
Grow the fuck up? I don't know--
--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------

@ boat rentals place, after trip to island

        [SIGNAGE]
    (sign is flipped to "closed"/ piece of reciept paper taped 
    to window that reads:
    "will return (original text marked out) sometime tomorrow")

        KIT
Now what?

        HELEN
Dunno. (tosses keys up into the air and catches them in her palm) 
Guess I could give 'em to some kid. Let him take that bad boy for a spin.
    (shot cut to boat bobbing beside the dock)(writing on side of boat 
    says "bad boy" or equivalent)

        KIT
    (puts his hand over Helen's palm, their hands together 
     now clasping the keys)
Hen?

        HELEN

..

        KIT


(sound of the ocean picks up -audio-here.mp3-)
(shot cut to ocean again but the boat is just alllmost out of view 
on the left of our screen)
(add depth to this scene by building irl a lil 3d stack of papers(or 
perhaps a more structurally-sound building material..) 
spaced and backlit so we can have lighting and vibes yeahhh and depth but
i said that already)



--------------------------------------------
 PLOTto > if you don't admit to killing the dog.

        KIT
    What was that about?

 >you write in your notebook: "checkov's gun collection"

        KIT
    Fuck it, man. Are you walking home or what?
 
 >you, helen. are at a loss for words. perhaps the most lost you've ever been.
 >Kit leaves without you.
--------------------------------------------

 NOW WHAT? ? ?

>your parents have a nasty little cat that licks u cus u taste like fish

>hm? maybe u dont actually get fired immediately.
